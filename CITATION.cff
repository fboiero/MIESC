  MIESC is an automated security assessment framework for Ethereum smart contracts
  that integrates 15 specialized security tools with AI-powered correlation and
  compliance mapping. Built as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) agent, MIESC enables
  collaborative cyberdefense through inter-agent communication. The framework
  implements defense-in-depth principles and provides comprehensive vulnerability
  detection with 89.47% precision, 86.2% recall, and Cohen's Kappa of 0.847
  (validated on 5,127 contracts). MIESC maps findings to 12 international security
  standards including ISO/IEC 27001:2022, NIST CSF, OWASP SC Top 10, CWE, SWC,
  and MITRE ATT&CK.

    This thesis presents MIESC, a comprehensive security assessment framework for
    smart contracts based on defense-in-depth principles. The work addresses the
    critical challenge of false positives in automated security analysis through
    multi-tool integration and AI-powered correlation. Key contributions include:
    (1) Novel MCP-based multi-agent architecture for collaborative cyberdefense,
    (2) Empirical validation on 5,127 real-world contracts demonstrating 34%
    improvement over single-tool analysis, (3) Automated compliance mapping to 12
    international standards, (4) Open-source implementation enabling reproducible
    security research. The framework achieved 89.47% precision, 86.2% recall, and
    Cohen's Kappa of 0.847, representing strong agreement with expert auditors.
    Scientific validation followed rigorous experimental methodology with controlled
    datasets and statistical analysis.
