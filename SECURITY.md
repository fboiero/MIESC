## Security Features

MIESC implements multiple security layers:

### 1. Agent Isolation
- Agents run in separate processes (future: containers)
- Resource limits prevent denial of service
- Filesystem access restrictions

### 2. Input Validation
- All contract paths are sanitized
- File size limits enforced (max 10MB)
- Solidity syntax validation before analysis
- Prevention of directory traversal attacks

### 3. Dependency Management
- All dependencies pinned to specific versions
- Regular security audits with `pip-audit`
- Minimal dependencies to reduce attack surface
- No execution of untrusted code

### 4. MCP Security
- Authentication required for MCP server
- Rate limiting on analysis requests
- Input sanitization on all MCP tool calls
- Secure communication protocols

### 5. Web Security
- XSS protection in dashboard
- CSRF tokens on forms
- Content Security Policy headers
- No inline JavaScript execution

## Security Best Practices for Users

### For Auditors Using MIESC

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Run MIESC in isolated environments
- Keep MIESC updated to latest version
- Review analysis results manually
- Use official agents from trusted sources
- Verify agent signatures (when available)

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Run as root/administrator
- Analyze untrusted contracts on production systems
- Install unverified third-party agents
- Share sensitive contracts publicly
- Disable security features

### For Agent Developers

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Validate all inputs
- Use subprocess timeouts
- Handle errors gracefully
- Document security considerations
- Follow the SecurityAgent protocol strictly

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Execute arbitrary code from contracts
- Make unvalidated network requests
- Store sensitive data in logs
- Use eval() or exec() on untrusted input
- Bypass protocol security checks

### For Protocol Teams (CI/CD Integration)

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Run MIESC in containerized CI/CD
- Use read-only filesystem mounts
- Set resource limits (CPU, memory, time)
- Review analysis results before deployment
- Keep secrets out of contract code

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Run with admin privileges
- Store results in public locations
- Deploy contracts with unresolved criticals
- Use default configurations in production
- Skip manual review of findings

---

## Known Security Considerations

### 1. Malicious Contracts

**Risk:** Analyzing contracts designed to exploit analysis tools.

**Mitigation:**
- Never execute contract code
- Use static analysis only
- Sandboxed environments for dynamic analysis
- Timeout enforcement
- Resource limits

### 2. Supply Chain Attacks

**Risk:** Compromised dependencies introducing vulnerabilities.

**Mitigation:**
- Pinned dependency versions
- Regular `pip-audit` scans
- Minimal dependency tree
- Reproducible builds
- Verification of critical dependencies

### 3. Agent Marketplace Risks

**Risk:** Malicious agents in future marketplace.

**Mitigation (Planned v2.1):**
- Code signing and verification
- Community trust ratings
- Sandboxed agent execution
- Permission system
- Automated security scanning

### 4. False Negatives

**Risk:** Missing critical vulnerabilities.

**Mitigation:**
- Multi-agent analysis (defense-in-depth)
- Regular updates to detection patterns
- Community-driven agent ecosystem
- Human review of findings
- Continuous improvement via feedback
