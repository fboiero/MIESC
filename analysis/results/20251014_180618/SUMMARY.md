### Tools Executed
- [x] Slither (Static Analysis)
- [x] Foundry (Testing & Fuzzing)
- [x] Echidna (Property-Based Fuzzing)
- [x] AI Assistant (Triage)

### Results Overview

- `analysis/results/20251014_180618/foundry/`
- `analysis/results/20251014_180618/ai/`

### Recommendations
1. Review all HIGH severity findings from Slither
2. Investigate property violations from Echidna
3. Check AI-triaged critical issues
4. Address test failures from Foundry

## Next Steps
