```bash
./demo_presentation.sh
```

This will:
1. Organize vulnerable contracts from examples
2. Select the reentrancy vulnerability for demo
3. Show the vulnerable code
4. Run multi-agent analysis (Slither + Ollama)
5. Show individual agent evidence files
6. Generate enhanced reports with conclusions and next steps
7. Open interactive dashboard

**Duration:** ~10 minutes (depending on Ollama speed)

---

# 4. Open dashboard
open output/demo_reentrancy/reports/dashboard.html

# 5. View detailed report with conclusions
cat output/demo_reentrancy/reports/consolidated_report.md
```

---

## 📊 What the Enhanced Reports Show

### 1. Detailed Findings

Each vulnerability now includes:

```markdown
### Finding #1: Reentrancy

**Agent:** Slither (Static Analysis)
**Severity:** HIGH
**Location:** contract.sol:21

**💥 Impact:**
- Attacker can drain contract funds
- Critical security vulnerability

**✅ Recommendation:**
- Use Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern
- Add ReentrancyGuard from OpenZeppelin
- Update state before external calls
```

### 2. Conclusions Section

```markdown
## 🎯 Conclusions

### ⚠️ Critical Issues Identified

This contract has **3 high-severity vulnerabilities** that require
immediate attention before deployment.

**Status:** ❌ NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION

### 🤖 Multi-Agent Analysis

This report combines findings from:
- **Slither Agent** - Static analysis with 87 detectors
- **Ollama Agent** - AI-powered logic analysis

Each agent provides independent evidence, maximizing vulnerability
detection coverage.
```

### 3. Next Steps Section

```markdown
## 📋 Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Priority: HIGH)

1. **Fix Critical Vulnerabilities**
   - Address all high-severity findings
   - Apply recommended patches
   - Re-run analysis to verify fixes

2. **Security Audit**
   - Engage professional auditors
   - DO NOT deploy to mainnet until issues are resolved

3. **Testing**
   - Write exploit tests for identified vulnerabilities
   - Verify fixes work correctly
   - Test on testnet extensively

### Further Analysis

Consider running additional analysis:

```bash
# Symbolic execution (deeper analysis)
python main_ai.py contract.sol analysis --use-mythril

# Multi-contract project analysis
python main_project.py contracts/ project --visualize --use-ollama
```
```

## 🎬 Presentation Flow

### Step 1: Introduction (1 min)
"MIESC uses multiple specialized agents to analyze smart contracts.
Each agent generates independent evidence that we consolidate into
professional reports."

### Step 2: Show Vulnerability (2 min)
```bash
cat vulnerable_contracts/reentrancy/reentrancy.sol
```
"This is a classic reentrancy vulnerability - similar to The DAO hack."

### Step 3: Run Analysis (2 min)
```bash
python main_ai.py vulnerable_contracts/reentrancy/reentrancy.sol demo --use-slither --use-ollama
```
"Watch as multiple agents analyze independently..."

### Step 4: Show Evidence Files (2 min)
```bash
cat output/demo/Slither.txt | head -20
cat output/demo/Ollama.txt | head -20
```
"Each agent generates its own evidence file for transparency."

### Step 5: Generate Reports (1 min)
```bash
python generate_reports.py output/demo "Demo"
```
"Now we consolidate everything into professional reports..."

### Step 6: Show Dashboard (2 min)
```bash
open output/demo/reports/dashboard.html
```
"Interactive dashboard with all findings, conclusions, and next steps."

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Practice once** before the real presentation
2. **Use large font** in terminal (Cmd/Ctrl + to zoom)
3. **Have backup** - if demo fails, show pre-generated reports
4. **Emphasize transparency** - show how evidence files work
5. **Highlight conclusions** - this is what stakeholders care about
