# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for MIESC.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs help:

- Document the reasoning behind decisions
- Onboard new team members
- Avoid revisiting old decisions
- Track the evolution of the architecture
