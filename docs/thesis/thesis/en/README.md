## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This thesis develops **Xaudit**, an automated framework for security evaluation of smart contracts on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The research integrates static analysis techniques (Slither), property-based fuzzing (Echidna) and coverage-guided (Medusa), differential testing (Foundry), formal verification (Certora), and artificial intelligence for vulnerability triage and classification.

### Problem Statement
Manual smart contract audits are expensive (USD $50,000-$500,000), slow (4-8 weeks), and prone to human error. Individual tools generate high volumes of false positives (>50%) without contextual prioritization.

### Hypothesis
A hybrid pipeline combining multiple analysis techniques with AI assistance significantly improves critical vulnerability detection (+30%), reduces false positives (-40%), and decreases analysis time (-95%) compared to traditional methods.

### Methodology
- **Paradigm:** Quantitative experimental
- **Dataset:** 30+ ad-hoc designed vulnerable contracts + 20 real cases
- **Metrics:** Precision, Recall, F1-Score, analysis time, coverage
- **References:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022, ISO/IEC 42001:2023, NIST SSDF, OWASP SCSVS

### Main Results
1. **Improved detection:** Hybrid pipeline detects 34% more vulnerabilities than Slither alone
2. **FP reduction:** AI reduces false positives by 43% through contextual classification
3. **Time efficiency:** Complete analysis in <2 hours vs. 4-8 weeks manual
4. **Coverage:** 94.7% code coverage through coverage-guided fuzzing
5. **Open-source:** Framework published for academic and industrial use

### Contributions
1. **Scientific:** First complete integration of static, dynamic, formal analysis and AI for EVM
2. **Practical:** Reduction of preliminary audit costs by >90%
3. **Educational:** Teaching material for smart contract security education
4. **Strategic:** Tool for protecting critical blockchain infrastructure
