## ⚙️ Configuration

### Timing Customization

Edit in `hacker_demo.py`:

```python
# Animation timings
typing_effect(text, delay=0.03)      # Writing speed
loading_bar(title, duration=2)       # Bar duration
pulse_text(text, times=3)            # Pulse repetitions
time.sleep(1)                        # Pauses between sections
```

### Color Customization

```python
# Define in class Colors
CUSTOM_COLOR = '\033[38;5;XXXm'  # XXX = color code 0-255
```

### Change Test Contract

```python
# In __init__
self.contract_path = "path/to/your/contract.sol"
```

---

## 🎓 Usage for Presentations

### Thesis Defense (10 minutes)

## 📊 Data Shown

### Real Metrics
- ✅ Dynamically calculated execution time
- ✅ Vulnerabilities counted from Slither JSON
- ✅ Statistics based on real analysis

### Comparison Metrics
- ✅ Based on academic studies
- ✅ Cohen's Kappa from real experiments

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Error: "Slither not found"
```bash
pip install slither-analyzer
```

### Error: "Contract not found"
```bash
# Verify that test_contracts/VulnerableBank.sol exists
ls -la test_contracts/VulnerableBank.sol
```

### Colors not showing
```bash
# Verify ANSI support in terminal
echo -e "\033[32mGreen\033[0m"

# If it doesn't work, use a modern terminal:
# - iTerm2 (macOS)
# - Windows Terminal (Windows)
# - GNOME Terminal (Linux)
```

### Demo too slow/fast
Edit delays in the code:
```python
# Make faster
typing_effect(text, delay=0.01)  # default: 0.03
loading_bar(title, duration=1)   # default: 2

# Make slower
typing_effect(text, delay=0.05)
loading_bar(title, duration=3)
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### For Presentations
1. **Practice beforehand** - Run 2-3 times to familiarize
2. **Narrate live** - Don't let it run silently
3. **Pause strategically** - Use pauses to explain
4. **Large terminal** - 18-20pt font minimum
5. **Dark background** - Better contrast for projector

### For Demos
1. **Verify Slither** - Test analysis before demo
2. **Backup plan** - Have screenshots if it fails
3. **Network backup** - Don't depend on internet
4. **Timing** - Know duration of each phase

### For Recordings
1. **Clean screen** - `clear` before starting
2. **Mute notifications** - Don't show popups
3. **Full screen** - Maximize terminal
4. **Clear audio** - Synchronized narration
